## ✨ Features

*   **Dimension Shifting Mechanics**: Navigate the same physical space across three distinct planes of existence. What is a wall in one world might be a path in another.
    *   **Reality (Human)**: The gray, chaotic world of giants.
    *   **Heaven**: A blue, ethereal realm of air currents.
    *   **Hell**: A red, scorching abyss of danger.
*   **Spatial Awareness Puzzle**: You must memorize the layout of other dimensions. Switching into a solid object causes "Spatial Conflict," instantly destroying your fragile form.
*   **Retro Aesthetics**: Immersive CRT monitor effects, scanlines, and pixel art style.
*   **Dark Narrative**: Experience a tragic, humorous story from the perspective of a moth who mistakes a bug zapper for a deity.
